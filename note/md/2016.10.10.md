Branch Tips
The implementation behind Git branches is much more lightweight than SVN’s model. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commits—it's not a container for commits. The history for a branch is extrapolated through the commit relationships.

This has a dramatic impact on Git's merging model. Whereas merges in SVN are done on a file-basis, Git lets you work on the more abstract level of commits. You can actually see merges in the project history as a joining of two independent commit histories.
