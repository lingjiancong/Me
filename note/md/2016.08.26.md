Non-blocking I/O (usually called NIO, and sometimes called "New I/O")..... I had always thought it New I/O.. ouh!!

Features:

- Buffers for data of primitive types
- Character set encoders and decoders
- A pattern-matching facility based on Perl-style regular expressions (in package java.util.regex)
- Channels, a new primitive I/O abstraction
- A file interface that supports locks and memory mapping of files up to Integer.MAX_VALUE bytes (2 GiB)
- A multiplexed, non-blocking I/O facility for writing scalable servers
##
1. NIO buffers
2. Channels
3. Selectors
