
#### Spring Data JPA ####

###### How persitence.xml works? #####

My understanding: persitence.xml is an entityManagerFactory  

    @PersistenceContext(name = "unitName")
    private EntityManager em;

###### How springboot finds repository? ######

By default, Spring Boot will enable JPA repository support and look in the package (and its subpackages) where @SpringBootApplication is located. If your configuration has JPA repository interface definitions located in a package not visible, you can point out alternate packages using @EnableJpaRepositories and its type-safe basePackageClasses=MyRepository.class parameter.
